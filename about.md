# Zen Garden

A mod that adds the Zen Garden from Plants Vs. Zombies into Geometry Dash!

## Features
- Feed and grow your players
- Customize your garden with various player icons
- Use Diamond Shards to purchase new players *(This uses your actual Diamond Shards)*

## How to Use
- Go to the shop to buy an icon *(first icon is free)*
- Go back to your zen garden to see your icon *(texture and color is random)*
- At the top left of the slot, there is an image representing what the icon needs fed
- Feed your icon what it says *(if it needs orbs, click on the orbs button and click on the icon, same for stars, moons, and diamonds)*
- When you feed your icon, there is an 80% chance you get 10 diamond shards, 17% chance you get 100 diamond shards, and 3% chance you get 500 diamond shards.
- You can click on an icon to see it's maturity level, rename it, or sell it.
- Once the icon is at maturity level 5, it will not level up and will constantly require moons.
- You can move an icon by clicking the move button at the top *(blue square)*, selecting the icon that you want to move, and then the slot you want to move it to.
- Grow your garden!
